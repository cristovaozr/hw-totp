# Custom-made hardware TOTP token

This project is part of a desire of developing a HW token by myself. If this goes well, I might even create de hardware
device that this will execute.

Please read the `LICENSE` file for a full disclosure of this firmware and hardware license.

Exceptions are made for external components that might have their own license. Please see each external component at
`firmware/external` and `hardware/external`.

## Compiling the firmware

This project uses git submodules, therefore they must be initiated:
> `git submodule update --init`

After this, just hit `make` and it should be OK!
